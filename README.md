# TCGAmisc

The TCGAmisc package provides a suite of helper functions that aid in the
creation of a `MultiAssayExperiment` class object from The Cancer Genome Atlas
data. Functions like `extract` interact with packaged data objects (i.e.,
`FirehoseData`). Other functions like `readExonFiles` work on text files to
create a `GRangesList` object from exon level data.
